# People Data Labs Data
This repository contains the following:
- Compilation of CSV files containing information about schools and locations in the USA
- Scripts that help compile the initial set of information or parse that information into CSV files that would help with being used in People Data Labs.
# Goal
Since the People Data Labs Cleaner API has request limits, the goal of this repo is to bypass the need to clean text by instead storing as many locations and schools as possible with their cleaned data already given or a way that helps search for the right cleaned data in case of similar sounding names. In the current implementation, it uses the school's website as an indicator.
