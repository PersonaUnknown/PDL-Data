In the current implementation, it uses the school's website as an indicator.\r # Data Citation\r - (US Colleges and Universities)[https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-colleges-and-universities/table/?flg=en-us]\r - (US Public Schools)[https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-public-schools/export/?flg=en-us]\r - (US Private Schools)[https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-private-schools/table/?flg=en-us]\r - (US Cities)[https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities]",
